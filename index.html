            <h2>Common Tiramisu Question - Answerd</h2>
            <dl>
                <h3>What kind of rum do I use in tiramisu?</h3>
                <dd>Dark rum is best, but you can use brandy or your favorite coffee liqueur.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <h3>Eggwhites or whipped cream?</h3>
                <dd>Most tiramisu recipes use whipped egg whites OR whipped cream in the mascarpone cream layers. Egg whites contribute a more airy <br> texture, while whipped cream makes the filling a bit more rich. This recipe actually uses both, so you're getting both delightfull <br>textures.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <h3>Are the eggs cooked?</h3>
                <dd>Tiramisu is a no-bake dessert. The eggs yolks are gently cooked on the stovetop, but the egg whites are raw. Purchase pasteurized eggs <br> because they are safe to consume raw.</dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <h3>What size pan to use?</h3>
                <dd>This particular tiramisu recipe yields a large volume and the pan will be very full. Make sure your pan is large enough. I recommend a <br> 9x13 inch dish with at least 12-14 cup capacity. This 4 quart dish is wonderfull too.</dd>
